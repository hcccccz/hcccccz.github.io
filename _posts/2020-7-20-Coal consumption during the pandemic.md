## Coal consumption during the pandemic

COVID-19 pandemic has changed many aspects of our lives, making many things inconvenient. People must stay at home and wear masks when going outside, the pandemic increased the cost of living including the price raising and the shortage of supply. Many industries have been forced to shut down, especially the service sector, which accounts for a large part of the American economy. 

 

In this assignment, I will investigate the change in the amount of coal used for power generation during the pandemic. Coal is a major natural source that is used for power generation. It is still the most economical and efficient way to generate electricity. Approximately 40 percent of the worldâ€™s electricity comes from coal, near its highest share in decades. There are 80 countries using coal as the main fuel (CarbonBrief, 2020). Nearly 38 percent of power plants are coal-fueled currently (World Coal Association, 2019). We can safely say that modern society can hardly function without coal. Meanwhile, the burning of coal produces significant greenhouse gas emissions since carbon is the major component of coal.

China and the United States are two countries this project will focus on. The first case of Covid-19 was found in China in late December 2019 and the outbreak began in January 2020. China is a country where the pandemic started and firstly pandemic got contained. It will be interesting to see what has changed during the process. I also chose the United States because it strictly enforces shelter-in-place orders, a lot of factories, infrastructure, and transportation were severely restricted from the beginning. In the U.S., the outbreak started in March 2020. More importantly, there are lots of data, research available about China and the United States.

 

Both China and the United States have closed many factories and transportation to stop the spread of the disease and ensure the safety of workers. Industry and transportation are sectors that require a large amount of energy to run. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, industrial is responsible for 35% of energy, transportation is responsible for 37% (EIA, 2020). 

During the pandemic in the U.S., we can observe a downward trend in coal consumption. In January 2020, Consumption of coal for Electricity generation is 36,697 thousand short tons, in February, consumption is 31,971 thousand short tons, and in March consumption is 28,917 thousand short tons (EIA, 2020). Relative to the reduction of coal consumption to generate electricity from January 2020 to March 2020, cumulative confirmed Covid-19 cases upwardly increase from the same time period in the United States. We can safely indicate that consumption of coal changed is somewhat affected by the policy that serves for preventing the spread of COVID-19.

The same pattern can be observed in the data from China. According to the statistics from the National Bureau of Statistics, power generation from coal in China is 51654.3 hundred million KWH in December 2019. There are no data recorded in January 2020. In February 2020, only 7806.6 hundred million KWH power generated by coal. In March 2020, the time that COVID-19 started to contain in China, power generation from coal is 11745.9 hundred million KWH (National Bureau of Statistics, 2020). Based on the timeline of cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases, the upward trend represents that China government began to respond to the spread of the virus in February, and factories, infrastructures, transportation are closed. So we can see that power generated by coal reached the lowest point, 7806.6 hundred million KWH in February in China, and begin to increase in March 2020, the time that the spread of the COVID-19 is initially under control. factories, transportation, infrastructures reopen.

The evidence above suggests that there is a relationship between coal consumption in power generation and the spread of COVID-19. As the pandemic, we can observe an evident decline in coal consumption in China and the United States. In an aspect of climate change during the shelter-in-place, global carbon emissions have dropped 17%. But in my opinion, these decreases are not enough to have a distinct impact on current concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and thus lower global temperatures. The drop in CO2 emissions needs to be large enough to make a difference to the atmosphere compared to natural CO2 variability caused by plants and soils respond to change of temperature, humidity on a seasonal or annual scale (Global Monitoring Laboratory, 2020). Natural variability is so large that reduced emissions during an outbreak make changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations seem negligible.

The CO2 data from the Global Monitor Laboratory collected at Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii indicated that the trend of CO2 concentration still follows an upward pattern even though global emissions have declined 17%.

Although the conclusion is not very optimistic, global climate change is a long process, to prevent this process people must do everything possible to slow it down. For example, we have seen China and the United States reduced their consumption of coal during the pandemic and thus resulted in the reduction of CO2 emissions. Even though there are many ways that can also contribute to CO2 reductions, I think the best way is to gradually replace the fuel used to generate power. There are many alternatives to generate power like nuclear energy, hydroelectric power, the solar, wind, etc. Replacing coal offers other benefits also. Other pollutants that burn coal include SO2, NO, and CO. These pollutants cause damage to the human body in the long run.
