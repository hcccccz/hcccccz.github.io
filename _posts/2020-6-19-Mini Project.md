​	In this assignment, I will focus on the change in ocean temperature. ocean temperatures are an important indicator and aspect of global warming. It provides information on how global warming impacts on the ocean. The ocean absorbs heat that comes from emitted greenhouse gas and causes ocean warming. The ocean temperature also changes periodically. For example, El Nino, which occurs in the eastern Pacific Ocean, often affects the global climate. But observations show a slow rise in sea temperatures over the long term

​	Based on data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, we can observe an upper trend of global ocean temperature from the 1900s to the current by using the time series model. From 1900 to 2020, global ocean temperature anomalies have increased from approximately -0.40℃ to 0.95°C.

​	The ocean absorbs and stores not only energy that comes from solar radiation and infrared radiation but also energy emitted by greenhouse gases in the the atmosphere. Due to Human activities and industrial production, humans have burned massive fossil fuels, coals that generate greenhouse gases, and these gases can prevent heat from escaping to space from the earth's surface. Almost 90% of heat from the atmosphere is eventually absorbed by oceans and increase temperature (Bradford). What's more, Rising ocean temperatures have many negative effects.
​	For the ecosystem, ocean warming leads to ocean deoxygenation. ocean deoxygenation is a process of the reduction of oxygen in the ocean. The result of deoxygenation is the negative impact on the biodiversity since oxygen is essential for life in the ocean. Deoxygenation also affects species distribution, and Stimulate algal proliferation (IUCN, 2020). This graph shows that ocean warming reduces the solubility of oxygen and then reduces biodiversity by compressed habitat for the marine organism because of anoxic area expansion.

​	For humans, rising ocean temperatures have many effects. For example, sea level rise caused by ocean warming has compressed human living space by rising sea level. Also, ocean warming cause more severe tropical cyclone over the world Because the energy of tropical cyclones mainly comes from the heat of surface water. The effects of tropical cyclones are mainly seasonal. Tropical cyclones are strong in autumn and summer which cause the reduction of agricultural production. We can see that named storms in Atlantic region have increase since 1930.
